This is a program that allows you to make a Minecraft Server on a Linux computer or server. This was made by me and you can get the source here at GitHub.

**NOTE:** This will be very slow or not even run on an ARM based system such as the Raspberry Pi. If people want it I will show how to make it run on there.

### Installing:
SSH or open the terminal on your linux machine.

Type
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JudgeGlass/AutoServer.git
cd AutoServer
chmod +x Menu.sh
```

To start it, run
```bash
sudo ./Menu.sh
```

Press OK on the dialog and when itâ€™s done installing the required software, you will see this

Press yes (If you accept their agreement)

Once that is done, you will see this.
