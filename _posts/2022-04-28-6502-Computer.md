    Over the last year or so, I have been watching a lot of videos on YouTube about old computers, such as the Commodore 64 and MS-DOS compatibles. <br/>
    Inspired by the 8-Bit Guy and after watching a lot of Ben Eater videos, I haved developed a working 6502 based computer based on Ben Eaters design. <br/>
</p>
It Features:
<ol>
    <li>WDC 65C02 (Modern MOS 6510)</li>
    <li>WDC 65C22 (Modern MOS 6522)</li>
    <li>32K EEPROM</li>
    <li>32K SRAM</li>
    <li>2x BUS Headers (For expandability)</li>
</ol>

<em>Had to create adapter for NAND IC. Wrong footprint :(</em>

Lately, I have been watching a lot videos from Ben Heck and fascinated by his calculator collection. Because of this, I am currently trying to connect an old<br/>
    TI-83 caclulator display to the 6502 computer. I currently got the 6502 computer to talk to an Arduino Mega to controll the LCD, but it has been having too <br/>
    many problems. Instead, I'm most likely going to use the build-in 65c22 for controlling the TI LCD. If all else fails, I'll use an FPGA.
