JudgeGlass.NET is now Zicron! Why did I do this? I felt that my username wasn't a very professional name for an organization. Zicron 
feels more like a real company name. All my projects from this point forward will now be using the Zicron name. Although, I may still use the JudgeGlass.NET name in more personal projects.
